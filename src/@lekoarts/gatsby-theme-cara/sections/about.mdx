## About


I'm 32 years old guy who loves cycling - I make yearly up to 10,000 km +. My main focus is health, I train minimum 3 days per a week.
I work both on healthy body and mind - meditation is my daily routine. Last two years I learned how to practice cold exposition - Wim Hof became my master.
In programming, I'm most curious about react native as well as electron.js for both mobile/desktop development.
Besides, I watch movies, play video games. One of my fav movies is "ExMachina" & "Ghost in the shell".
